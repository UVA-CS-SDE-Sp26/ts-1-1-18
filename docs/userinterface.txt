Overview: This file (user interface) is a command-line interface. Its job is to read 
what the user types, make sure the command is a valid one, tell the other parts of the 
program what file to go to and print the final message on the screen, so it is back to the 
user.

What it does:
• Read the user's command-line input
• Validate that the command is valid
• Route valid commands to ProgramController
• Display the final output or error message to the user

Usage instructions: If a user provides an invalid input or more than two arguments, the  
program will display an error message (below) followed by instructions for how the program
worked.

Instructions: 
java topsecret -> list available files
java topsecret [num]  -> view file [num] and decipher using default key
java topsecret [num] [keyfile] -> view file [num] and decipher using [keyfile]

Examples
java topsecret 02
java topsecret 02 mycustonket.txt

Command logic and rerouting
- No arguments: triggers "list" command. UI will display the numbered index followed
                by the file name (handle no args)
- One argument (index): UI validates that the index is a number and corresponds to one 
                          of the filenames. It then passes this index to program control to 
                          display the file decoded with the normal key. (handle one args)
- Two arguments (index and key): UI validates the index and passes both the index and 
                                  path to the alternative key file to Program control to 
                                  display the decoded message (handle two args)
run(args)
    if length(args) == 0
        handleNoArgs()
    else if length(args) == 1
        displayfiles(args[0])
    else if length(args) == 2
        displayfiles(args[0], args[1])
    else
        handleTooManyArgs()

Error Handling (will exit prgram if any of these occur)
- Non-numeric Index: UI displays "Error: '(inputted index)' is not a valid file number
- Out of Bounds Index: UI displays: " Error "File number __ not found."
- Invalid Argument Count: If >2 arguments are entered, UI displays the Usage instructions 
  and exits
