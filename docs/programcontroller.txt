Program Controller Design (Team Member B):

Purpose:
The program controller was designed to take the arguments passed in by the user, and connect them
to the file handler to produce an output that would decipher the desired files using the default key
or the specified cipher.

Methods:
1. listFiles:
    This is a very simple method that just used the listFiles method from the file handler and prints the
    results

2. displayFiles:
    - This method is more complex and handles the one and two argument cases.
    - It begins with a check of valid arguments, starting with whether or not the first is an int.
    - It then takes in all the files from the listFiles method and splits them up into an array
    - The method then checks if your index is valid
    - The files are then split up between their number and their actual file name so the file handler can work with them
    - Null check the file and the key
    - If the key is not null the cipher will provide the file handled with the provided key
    - If the key is null the file handler will default to the standard key
    - The method will print out the file after it has been processed by the file handler.

3. handleTooManyArgs:
    - This simply tells the user if there are too many arguments and can be used by the user interface
      if the arguments are greater than 2.
