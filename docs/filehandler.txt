Basic User Flow:

1. Parse the command from the CLI to determine what file needs to be returned (or all files) (Ryan's part)
2. Main part for file handler: Open that file and read its contents. Save to a string.
3. Run decipher on the string (or on the file depending on Karina's implementation of the decipherer)
4. Return the value outputted from decipher code.

Tests (units):

Case: No user provided file argument
Expected output:
Should return the list of files as specified in array list format.
01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt

Case: User provided file argument
Expected output:
String containing deciphered text.
