FileHandler Design (Team Member B)

Purpose:
FileHandler is the only class that directly accesses mission files on disk.
It owns file discovery, file reading, and returning content for other parts of the program.

Scope and boundaries:
1. Reads files from a configured data directory (for example: data/).
2. Returns a numbered file list for "no-argument" CLI behavior.
3. Reads a selected file and returns deciphered text using the provided Cipher dependency.
4. Handles file access/read failures and returns clear error strings.
5. Other classes (UI/controller) must not read files directly.

Current behavior:
1. Constructor loads available filenames from the data directory.
2. Filenames are sorted so numbering is deterministic.
3. listFiles() returns numbered lines:
01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt
4. getAvailableFiles() returns the available filenames as a list for controller selection logic.
5. handleFile(filename):
- checks whether the requested path exists and is a regular file
- reads file contents
- calls Cipher.decipher(...)
- returns deciphered text
- if file does not exist: returns "File not found: <filename>"
- if reading fails: returns "Could not read file: <filename>"

Unit tests designed and implemented (FileHandlerTest):
1. loadAvailableFiles()
- verifies file list is loaded
- verifies expected test files are present (filea.txt, fileb.txt, filec.txt)

2. listFiles()
- verifies exact numbered output format:
01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt

3. handleFile()
- uses Mockito to mock Cipher
- verifies deciphered output returned by FileHandler
- verifies FileHandler calls Cipher.decipher(...) when reading a valid file

TDD notes:
1. Tests are focused on Team Member B responsibilities only.
2. File access remains encapsulated inside FileHandler per assignment requirement.
3. Controller/UI behavior is tested separately by other team responsibilities.
